            <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
            <article>
            Overwatch is a colorful team-based action game starring a diverse cast of powerful heroes. Travel the world, build a team, and contest objectives in exhilarating 6v6 combat.
            Released in 2016 by Blizzard Entertainment, Overwatch is a first-person multiplayer shooter, set in a future where a conflict between robots and humanity necessitated the creation of a task force, conveniently called "Overwatch."
            In the game's primary competitive mode, players are arranged into two teams of six and compete on a variety of maps and game types.

        <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>
            <article>
            Health is how much damage the characters can take before being eliminated. Tracer, a tiny British pilot who zips around the map, has 150 health, while Roadhog, an enormous Australian man with a gas mask and a shotgun, has 600.
            Certain characters also have armor, which reduces the amount of damage they take, or shields, which act like health but will regenerate on their own if the character doesn't take damage for a short period of time.
            Characters that are physically larger (and therefore easier to shoot) tend to have more health.<br>
            Damage is how much health the character can take away with their main weapon. Some characters do small amounts of damage very quickly; others do large amounts of damage all at once.
            Some characters are excellent at short ranges but struggle at long ranges, while others are the opposite.<br>
            <br>
            Abilities are where characters really start to stand out. Some characters, like the aforementioned Tracer, have abilities that allow them to move quickly and unpredictably, dodging fire and attacking from unexpected angles.
            Other characters, like Pharah or Mercy, are able to fly for a limited time, adding a vertical dimension to the game. Many tanks, like Reinhardt or Orisa, are able to deploy large barriers to protect their teams from harm.
            Supports, like Lucio or Baptise, have abilities that can heal their teammates and prevent them from dying. Not all abilities are created equal (some, like Ana's Sleep Dart or D.Va's Defense Matrix, are extraordinarily powerful
            when used by a skillful player), but utilizing your character's entire suite of abilities is extremely important.<br>
            <br>
            Ultimates are game-changing abilities that are only available a few times per match. While regular abilities can be used every few seconds, Ultimates have to be charged up before usage. Ultimate charge can accrue slowly on its own,
            but players can increase it very quickly by doing damage or healing their teammates. A single well-timed Ultimate can win a fight on its own. Genji's Dragonblade allows him to easily slice his way through an entire team, Wrecking Ball's
            Minefield can set up devastating combos and deny the enemy access to an area, and Zenyatta's Transcendence can allow his team to survive even the most lethal damage. Proper use of Ultimates -- whether on their own, in combo with other
            Ultimates or in response to an enemy Ultimate -- is the key to winning games in Overwatch. Some of the most exciting times in the game come when the crowd is anticipating a player utilizing his or her character's key Ultimate, either winning
            the fight or seeing it cruelly shut down by smart play from the opponents.

            There are many ways to play Overwatch. Start with the tutorial to learn the fundamentals of play. Once youâ€™ve completed it, you can head to the Main Menu to try out various game modes available:

            Within Quick Play or Competitive Play, there are three types of gameplay modes depending on the map: Payload (escort), point capture (assault), and control. There is another mode
