            <h3>Reinhardt</h3>
            <p>
        Reinhardt is an incredibly strong tank and a great addition to a variety of hero combinations. You essentially dictate the pace of the game and it is important
        to ensure that you play aggressively when possible. This does not mean to dive into the enemy team and die alone, but to communicate with your team to push effectively.
        One of the biggest issues in most games is the standstill that often occurs at choke points. The attacking team does not play aggressively enough and the defense
        team is happy to let that happen.<br>
        <br>
        The aggressive playstyle is even more important when both teams have a Reinhardt. Force the enemy Reinhardt back and charge your Earthshatter Icon Earthshatter on him by
        swinging your hammer into him. Ensure that you are dictating the flow of the game rather than simply sitting on the back foot waiting for them to push and wipe your team.

            <h3>D.Va</h3>
        <article>
        D.Va is arguably one of the most difficult tanks to play in all of Overwatch. When D.Va starts in spawn, she controls (for gameplay purposes, is) a 600-health mech with
        close range weapons: Fusion Cannons Icon Fusion Cannons, Micro Missiles Icon Micro Missiles, a movement ability: Boosters Icon Boosters, and a protective shield: Defense Matrix
        Icon Defense Matrix. However, when D.Va's mech is destroyed, she disembarks and is simply a human with a pistol: Light Gun Icon Light Gun, and a dream: Call Mech Icon Call Mech.<br>
        <br>
        As D.Va, you can help your team in two ways. You can either harass and disrupt enemies by using your low-cooldown Boosters (that allow you to fly anywhere for 2 seconds) to reach
        slow opponents who then face D.Va's Fusion Cannons and Micro Missiles, or you can focus on protecting your team by utilizing Defense Matrix and the mech's large frame (keep in mind
        that you cannot shoot D.Va's Fusion Cannons while Defense Matrix is active).<br>
        <br>
        Your high resilience makes you ideal for harassing and killing DPS or support heroes who are split from their team. Your size and Boosters ability allow you to peel for ally heroes.
        Last but not least, D.Va can use her Self-Destruct Icon Self-Destruct ultimate in a handful of crafty ways that have huge impacts on the match. Self-Destruct can either zone the enemy
        team for several seconds, force a team to split for easy picks, or simply kill opponents outright.

            <h3>Winston</h3>
        <article>
        Winston is a high mobility main tank used in dive and hybrid team compositions. His main goal is to attack weak or slow enemy healers and dps heroes. His size and his kit help him
        distract the enemy team while his team rushes onto their targets. Winston's main source of damage comes from his primary weapon Tesla Cannon Icon Tesla Cannon, an auto-locking multi-target
        beam weapon that deals sustained damage over time. Although this weapon is not known for its damage, when matched with Winston's health and other abilities, it can make for a devastating tool.<br>
        <br>

        Winston's main mobility ability is called Jump Pack Icon Jump Pack. Jump Pack lets Winston launch into the air, damaging enemies who are unfortunate enough to find themselves at its point of
        impact. This ability has a short cooldown that lets players jump in, harass enemies, and jump back out again with little to worry about.<br>
        <br>
        Winston needs some extra protection when he confronts enemies on their turf, which is why Barrier Projector Icon Barrier Projector is a perfect tool to help Winston stay alive through his attack.
        Barrier Projector is a dome-shaped barrier that allows Winston to attack his enemies from inside the hemisphere while staying safe behind its shield.
