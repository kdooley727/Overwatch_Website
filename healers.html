            <h3>Mercy</h3>
        Although Mercy is seemingly a straightforward hero, there are a few decisions players can make that can change the tide of battle.
        Mercy players must understand the dynamics of every team fight to make crucial decisions about which ally to heal/damage boost with
        Caduceus Staff Icon Caduceus Staff, when or who to Resurrect Icon Resurrect, and how to escape enemy fire. In fact, how a player
        answers these questions is what often makes the difference in their skill rating.<br>
        <br>
        As a healer, Mercy's main job is to ensure that her team stays alive. However, in some scenarios, using Caduceus Staff Icon Caduceus
        Staff to damage boost an ally is the better play. For example, if a hero is using their ultimate, Mercy should consider damage boosting
        them through the ultimate in order to deal more damage. Damage boosting is also a helpful tool at the beginning of an engagement since
        no one has been injured yet. In fact, damage boosting a Junkrat or Widowmaker before a fight begins can help your team secure a pick,
         forcing the enemy team to either: attack a man down or wait for their teammate to respawn.

            <h3>Lucio</h3>
        Lucio is the only healer in Overwatch capable of healing multiple targets at one time (not counting Soldier: 76's limited use of
        Biotic Field Icon Biotic Field). This makes him a very valuable asset to any team in most situations.<br>
        <br>
        Lucio's healing aura does not work on targets who are not in his line of sight, or out side of a 30-meter radius around Lúcio.
        oupled with the fact that Lúcio can do reasonable damage with his gun while the healing aura is active, this all means that
        you have many reasons to be in the middle of the action for as long as possible.<br>
        <br>
        Lucio can also help his team with Crossfade (Speed Boost) Icon Crossfade (Speed Boost). In particular, this can get the team
        back to the point or Payload quicker after dying, or it can allow players to avoid abilities that would otherwise have caught them off guard.

            <h3>Moira</h3>
            Moira O'Deorain is a geneticist who specializes in biotic fluids that can both help and harm soldiers during combat. This scientist turned
            Talon councilwomen fights only for herself and her quest to change the world through genetic mutations. Similar to other mad scientists,
            Moira wants to push the boundaries of ethics and humanity in order to actualize the highly controversial capabilities of unhindered scientific study.<br>
            <br>
            Moira is a main support who specializes in healing batches of teammates in a short span of time. Her primary fire weapon, Biotic Grasp (LMB) Icon
            Biotic Grasp (LMB), is not a weapon at all, but an energy that flows from her left arm and heals the allies in front of her in a specific area of effect radius.<br>
            <br>
            lthough Moira has one of the best AoE healing abilities in the game, she also has the option to deal damage through her Biotic Grasp (RMB) Icon Biotic Grasp (RMB).
            This single-target ability is a flow of energy that sucks the life out of her enemy, healing Moira of any damage she may have sustained on the battlefield.
            One of the main decisions Moira players have to make is whether to heal their team or heal themselves while dealing damage. When Moira is attacked with her team,
            she may have to choose between healing her allies or staying alive. The choice in these critical scenarios is one of the major contributing factors to excellent Moira play
