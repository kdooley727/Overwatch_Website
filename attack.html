    <h3>Junkrat</h3>
        Junkrat is a defensive hero in Overwatch. The hero revolves around his peculiar weapon, the Frag Launcher Icon Frag Launcher, which lobs grenades that explode after
        3 bounces (regardless of range) or on direct contact with enemies, dealing damage in an area. The grenades can be bounced off of any objects in the game, meaning that
        Junkrat can throw them around corners and at all sorts of odd angles. This, coupled with the splash damage and the fairly continuous rate of fire (5 grenades per 3 seconds
        and a 1.5-second reload time) make Junkrat a very spammy hero that is great at putting down blanket damage in narrow corridors or other choke points.<br>
        <br>
        As Junkrat, you will spend the vast majority of your time lobbing grenades at the other team, bouncing them off objects in such a way that you yourself are not exposed
        to enemy fire. You can even fight enemies face to face quite effectively, but only in small, enclosed areas where the grenades can deal their splash damage, and where
        they are likely to hit enemies directly.

            <h3>Soldier: 76</h3>
        Soldier: 76's entire kit is built around this idea. His rifle's flexibility allows him to have high uptime on dealing damage, and his damage is actually viable at most ranges.
        This means that you should make use of the advantage your rifle offers, and put down near-constant fire towards the enemy team.<br>
        <br>
        His Biotic Field Icon Biotic Field heal helps him stay in the fight longer (healing himself and allies as needed, ideally under some form of cover), while his Sprint is often
        used to get back into the action as quickly as possible after dying or retreating; it also helps with getting to cover quicker, or dashing for a health pack.<br>
        <br>
        That said, while Soldier: 76 can effectively deal damage at most ranges, he really excels at medium range. In close range, he will practically always lose against
        McCree (chiefly due to the McCree's Flashbang Icon Flashbang), and at best he has no real advantage over heroes like Tracer, Genji, or Reaper. At long range, Solider: 76 is also
        at a disadvantage against snipers (Widowmaker/Hanzo) and Bastion.

            <h3>Mei</h3>
        <article>
        Mei is a defensive hero that specialises in frost-based abilities to disrupt the enemy team. At close range, Mei's damage potential is very high, and she can easily challenge any
        hero if she makes use of her Endothermic Blaster Icon Endothermic Blaster's primary fire to slow or freeze her target. Due to the damage drop-off of her alternate fire at longer
        ranges (and due to the limited range of her primary fire), she is less and less viable the farther away her enemies are.<br>
        <br>
        Mei is very useful to her team if she focuses on her strength, which is disruption of the enemy team. Her Ice Wall Icon Ice Wall blocks the targeted area for up to 4.5 seconds,
        making it extremely effective in a variety of situations (preventing enemies from advancing or retreating, separating enemy teams, etc), while the slowing effect of her Endothermic
        Blaster can frustrate enemies and make them easier targets for Mei's teammates.<br>
        <br>
        All in all, Mei works almost as a utility hero. With the exception of some rare moments, she does not get to shine at the forefront like offense or even some defense heroes
        (Widowmaker, Bastion), and instead she is there to increase the efficiency of her more damaging teammates.
